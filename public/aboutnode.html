        <h1>Node.js</h1>
        <p>Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and
            more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes
            JavaScript code outside a web browser.</p>

        <p>Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability
            to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is
            sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,
            unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different
            languages for the server- versus client-side programming.</p>

        <p>Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize
            throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time
            Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).</p>

        <p>The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now
            merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS Foundation is facilitated by the Linux
            Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.</p>
